<h1>carol's grain silo</h1>
<p>
  Hi sowcoders africa!<br>
</p>

First,the reason why i started this project in my community and society is that it has a problem of food shortage<br>
About ahalf of my community lack storage facilites that leds to destruction cereals that leds to hunger<br>
</p>
The silo will help the community to store there cereals upto the time of hunger<br>
also it will create employment to the youths <br>
the project will help people be their own seif-employed in their farm<br>
also agricultural skill and knowledge will be applied in the farm<br>
